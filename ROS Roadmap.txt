ROS - Robot Operating System

1. Prerequisites
Before diving into ROS, make sure you have:

Basic Linux skills (Ubuntu command line, file handling, permissions, shell scripting)
Python and C++ programming (Python for scripting, C++ for performance-critical applications)
Basic knowledge of robotics (Kinematics, control systems, and sensor integration)



2. Getting Started with ROS
Step 1: Install ROS
Install ROS noetic (for Ubuntu 20.04)
or Install ROS 2 Humble(for Ubuntu 22.04)


Step 2: Understanding ROS Basics
Basic ROS commands like roscore, rosrun, roslaunch, Nodes, Topics, Messages, Services, Actions, and Parameters
For ROS workspace we need to setup catkin_make for ROS 1 or colcon for ROS 2
To Visualize and debug we need to use rqt_graph and rostopic
sample project: writing a simple Publisher-Subscriber in python and C++

Step 3: Working with ROS tools:
RViz for Visualization
Gazebo for robot simulation
rosbag for recording and replying data
TF(Tranform Library) for coordinate Transformations


3. Intermediate Level

Step 4: Robot Simulation and control:
Simulating a robot in gazebo
Controlling a robotic arm using Moveit
Using ROS navigation stack(SLAM, Path Planning)


Step 5: Sensor Integration:
Working with LIDAR, IMU, & Camera
Using OpenCV with ROS for image processing
Point cloud processing with PCL

Step 6: Writing Custom ROS packages:
Creating custom messages and services
Using dynamic_reconfiguare
Managing launch files efficiently

4. Advanced Level

Step 7: ROS Autonomous Systems
Autonomous navigation with SLAM
implementing path planning algorithms(A*, Dijkstra, RRT)
Object detection and grasping with deep learning 

step 8: ROS2 & Advanced Concepts
Difference between ROS1 & ROS2
DDS(Data Distribution Services) and real-time communication
writing ROS2 nodes with rclcpp and rclpy
using ROS2 with Docker and Kubernetes

step 9: Multi-Robot Systems 
Swarm robotics with ROS
Multi-Robot coordination using ROS Multi-Master

step 10: Hardware Integration
Using ROS with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Jetson Nano
Controlling robotic arm, drones, and self-driving cars


5. Hands-on projects
Build a ROS-based mobile robot
Implement Autonomous Navigation
Create a ROS-Powered robotic ARM
Work on real-world robotic competitions( like TurtleBot Challenges)
